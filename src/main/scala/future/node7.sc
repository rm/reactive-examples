/* This worksheet demonstrates some of the code snippets from
* Week3, Lecture 3, "Combinators on Futures", especially Slide 6.
* The sending commands are made more complicated, so that failure
* can occur in multiple ways. In particular, a sending to Europe
* can fail, or a sending to the USA, or both.
* Although a straight-forward modification of the previous flatMap method
* does catch the exceptions, it considers it a failure if either sending
* fails. Also, only the first occuring failure is reported.
